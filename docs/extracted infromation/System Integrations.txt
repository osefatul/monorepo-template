System Integrations
The service's value comes from its ability to interact with other critical bank systems.

Integration with WebKYC: This is a crucial API integration. The Auth Signer Service makes a secure API call to the existing WebKYC Service once a request is fully approved. The API payload includes details like the client ID, signer ID, and the action (e.g., ADD_SIGNER, REMOVE_SIGNER). This ensures WebKYC, the system of record for privileges, is always in sync with the new Auth Signer service.

Integration with Onboarding: This is an initial, strategic integration. The new Onboarding Service will be updated to make an API call directly to the Auth Signer Service when a new client is onboarded. This POST request will create the initial Auth Signer record in the new repository, ensuring clean, structured data from the very beginning of the client relationship.

Integration with Downstream Systems: In future phases, other systems like the SWP and STA will be integrated via APIs. The Auth Signer Service will have a GET API that these systems can call to verify an Auth Signer's authority in real-time, eliminating manual verification.
