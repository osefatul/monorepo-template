Based on this meeting transcript, here are the key details about the Auth Signer project:
User Management & System Structure
Internal User Interface Planning:

Auth Signer management will be housed within existing "User Management" section
Different signer types exist: contract signers, designers, etc.
Display will show signer permissions, email, account associations, and status
Question raised about how signers associate with different account types (deposits, investments, loans, credits)

Data Model & Account Association
Account-Level Management:

Authorized signers are managed at individual account level, not customer level
Single customer can have multiple accounts with different signer lists
One account can have multiple authorized signers (10, 15, 20+ possible)
Primary/admin user profiles may be common across accounts

Onboarding Integration
New Signer Setup Process:

During onboarding, initial signer list established with KYC verification
For existing accounts, new signers must go through KYC process
Question about whether centralized signer database will allow reuse of existing verified signers
Need to determine if signer types/permissions come from onboarding data

Business Rules & Validation
Approval Workflows:

Some businesses allow single authorized signer to add others
Other businesses require dual approval (two signers must approve additions)
"Number of signers required" field determines approval workflow
Approval based on authorization type, not specific individuals

Editable Fields Discussion:

Personal info (name, phone, email, address) - mostly editable
Authorization type and permissions - editable
Account numbers - not editable (add/remove accounts instead)
Date of birth - generally not editable
Third-party (TPA) information - needs verification

Integration Requirements
External System Updates:

Changes must feed to multiple downstream systems
WebKYC integration for compliance validation
List of CME systems that need updates when signers change
All edits should trigger WebKYC updates

Digital Signature Capture:

Still working on digital signature implementation
Question about when signatures are captured in the workflow
Integration with KMS/HSM for secure signature storage

Workflow Clarifications
Add/Remove vs Transfer:

No separate "transfer" functionality needed
Transfer is combination of add new signer + remove old signer
Need minimum signer thresholds to prevent complete removal

Edit vs Add/Remove:

Most changes handled through add/remove rather than edit
Only basic personal info changes (phone, email) should be editable
Account associations changed through add/remove account process

Technical Implementation
Database & Development Setup:

Database provisioning and UI repository setup in progress
CI/CD pipeline configuration
Access controls and permissions being defined
Documentation completion planned

The transcript reveals this is an internal team planning session working through user interface design, business rules, and technical implementation details for the Auth Signer system's internal banking user experience.



Critical Dependencies & Integration Points
Onboarding Team Collaboration:

Onboarding team (different from Auth Signer team) is collecting basic signer data: name, title, email, phone
They're starting with GSF (Global Structured Finance), not CME
Auth Signer team starting with CME - parallel tracks
Future goal: onboarding feeds Auth Signer Service directly
Current reality: manual digitization process needed for existing data

OCR/Digitization Dependency:

Separate "Digital Document" team exists at the bank for OCR capabilities
Team is analyzing sample forms to determine feasibility
High uncertainty about confidence scores and implementation timeline
Decision: Skip OCR dependency for initial development, build manual input capabilities
OCR integration will be parallel/future enhancement

Technical Architecture Decisions
Corporate Connect Integration:

Auth Signer will be federated application within Corporate Connect
No standalone authentication - leveraging CC's existing auth/session management
Entitlement-based access control for different business lines
Users will have role-based permissions (view, edit, specific business line access)

Data Integration Strategy:

Need account and organization data from existing systems
Manual form digitization required due to inconsistent formats across business lines
No standardized forms - every business line uses different formats
Fields vary significantly between business lines and even within same business line

Form Processing Challenges
Document Inconsistency:

No standard form templates across business lines
Forms can be typed or handwritten (mostly typed except signatures)
Required fields vary by business line
Historical data spans different time periods and formats

Manual Input Requirements:

Parallel manual input process needed regardless of OCR success
Confidence scoring critical for OCR validation
Manual review workflow required for low-confidence extractions
