# Auth Signer Project - Comprehensive Overview

## Executive Summary

The Auth Signer project is a digital transformation initiative to modernize authorized signer list (ASL) management across US Bank's commercial business lines. Currently processing 500+ monthly changes for CME alone through manual, email-based workflows, the system will establish a centralized, automated platform serving as the single source of truth for authorized signer data across 15-16 business lines.

**Project Timeline**: Q4 2025 MVP for CME, followed by IT&C, GSF, GCT expansion  
**Team**: Torrent Team (development), multiple business line partnerships  
**Investment**: Enterprise-grade platform with reusable architecture

## Business Problem & Current State

### Critical Pain Points
**Fragmented Data Storage**: ASL information scattered across FileNet, Chorus, SharePoint, shared drives, and email inboxes with no centralized repository.

**Manual Process Inefficiencies**: Email-driven workflows with multiple handoffs between Client Managers, Product Operations, Trust Review, and Risk partners leading to lost requests and processing delays ranging from minutes to months.

**Lack of Visibility**: Neither clients nor internal teams can track request status, leading to frequent status inquiry calls and client frustration.

**Compliance Risk**: Manual validation processes with inconsistent callbacks, varying approval workflows across business lines, and incomplete audit trails pose regulatory and operational risks.

**Operational Burden**: Bankers spend significant time on administrative tasks rather than relationship management, with some Client Managers having streamlined processes while others rely on manual research for each request.

### Current Volume & Impact
- **CME Business Line**: 500+ monthly changes with weeks-long processing times
- **Total Enterprise Scope**: 15-16 business lines requiring similar capabilities
- **Client Experience**: No self-service options, limited visibility, inconsistent service levels
- **Operational Cost**: High banker touch-time, manual validation, redundant data entry

## Business Line Configuration

### Configurable Business Rules
The system supports business line-specific configurations without code changes:

**CME Configuration Example**
- Dual approval required for all changes
- Maximum authorization limit: $1,000,000
- Approval timeout: 48 hours
- Required fields: email, phone, title, business address
- Custom export template with CME-specific verbiage

**IT&C Configuration Example**
- Single approval sufficient for most changes
- Maximum authorization limit: $500,000
